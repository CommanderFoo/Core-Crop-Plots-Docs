# Creating Plots

For a player to be able to plant crops, they need a zone for themself that is owned by just them.  In the example that comes with the system, there is 1 zone.  This is fine if you only have 1 player game.  But if you have a multiplayer game, you will need more zones.

Creating zones is simple.  It can be done by dragging and dropping the `Crop Plots - Plot` template into the `Plots` folder.  See the video below which shows you how I create 3 new zones that would be ideal for a 4 player game.

# Ideas For You

__More Crops__

Consider adding more crops so that players have a wide choice to plant.  Some crops could be tied to quests, some could be extremely rare.

&nbsp;

__Purchase Zone__

Make it so that players need to purchase a zone before they can start planting crops.  

&nbsp;

__Unlock Additional Crop Beds__

Maybe additional Crop Beds could be unlocked as the player levels up, or even tie it into Perks if players want additional space to plant crops.

&nbsp;

__Trading Rare Seeds__

Consider a trading system that allows players to trade for seeds that can not be purchased at the seed stall.  

&nbsp;

__Different Resources Harvested__

Maybe when harvesting some crops they produce other resources (i.e ferrous crop that produces chunks of iron that can be used in crafting).

# Crop Plots Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for `Crop Plots` found in [Core](https://coregames.com) Community Content.

This system will allow you to add player owned plots with crop beds so they can plant and harvest crops.  It comes with 3 crops to get you started, and a full example template with 1 player zone and 20 crop beds.

It's easy to add new zones and crop beds, check the other sections of the documentation which cover those in depth.

!!! tip
	For the sake of the example that comes with the system.  Crops have a low growth time.  It's advised to increase the time on these to be more suitable for your game.

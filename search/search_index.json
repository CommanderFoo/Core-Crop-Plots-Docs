By default a plot comes with 4 Crop Beds, but it's very easy to expand the zone and add additional Crop Beds. Warn Each Crop Bed must have a unique ID in that zone. On each Crop Bed object, there is a property called id . See the video below where I expand the amount of Crop Beds in one of the zones. Pay attention to the size of the zone, which is a trigger that must contain all the Crop Beds, and the setting of the id per Crop Bed.","title":"Creating Plot Beds"},{"location":"creating-crop-beds/#creating-plot-beds","text":"So you have your zones for players, you now need to create Crop Beds so they can plant crops in their zone.

Tip Start with the example template and desinstance it so you can modify it to suit your game. All crops are stored in a folder called Crops under the folder Crop Plots . Below are all the properties explained on the Crop Data script. Property Description id The ID for this crop. This must be unique. name The name of the crop. resource_key The resource key that will be used when storing this for the player. harvest_amount The amount the player will receive when the crop is harvested. icon The icon to use in the UI menus for this crop. description A description of the crop. growth_time The time in seconds it takes for this crop to be fully grown. buy_price The price of the seeds for this crop. sell_price The price the player will receive when selling this crop. template The crop template that will be spawned in the world in the crop beds. The next following properties control the scale and position of each stage of the crop. There are 3 stages to a crop that get tweened between to give a nice growing effect for players to see. These may be confusing, so it's recommended to look at how the existing crops that come with the system is done. The reason it's done like this is to give as much control to you as possible on the way the crop grows. Tip To get a better idea of scale and position, enter play mode and tweak the crops scale or position, copy them, then enter it into the properties on the script. This way it takes out a little bit of guess work and you will be able to see each stage in local play. Property Description stage_1_scale The scale of the crop object when it's first planted by the player. stage_1_pos The position of the crop object when it's first planted by the player. Ideally the crop should start lower down in the ground, and then at each stage after it moves up on the Z direction to give the effect of growning. stage_2_scale Second stage scale. stage_2_pos Second stage position. stage_3_scale Final stage scale. stage_3_pos Final stage position.","title":"Creating Crops"},{"location":"creating-crops/#creating-crops","text":"The system comes with Carrot, Watermelon, and Pumpkin crops, however you may want to add more crops to your game so players have a wide choice of things to plant.

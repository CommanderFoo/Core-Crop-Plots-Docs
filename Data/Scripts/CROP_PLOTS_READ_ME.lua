Well Hi there.

So you want to be a farmer?

Crop Plots is a system where players are assigned their own zone in which they can plant and harvest crops.  If you 
have played Farmers Market, then it's a very similar system.

While this is a basic system to get you up and running, it's easy to add your own crops.  It contains a full working
example of 1 zone with 20 crop beds, along with 2 stalls to buy additional seeds and sell harvested crops.

It's highly recommended to read the documentation on the web, because it contains lots of useful information, especially
if you want this to be multiplayer friendly so any player who joins will have their own zone.

NOTE:  Make sure to enable "Enable Player Storage" on your Game Settings object.

== Quick Start ==

1.  Drag and drop the template "Crop Plots - Example" into your hierarchy.
2.  Press "Play".

Walk into the zone, look at a crop bed and left click to open up the seed UI so you can pick which crop to plant.
